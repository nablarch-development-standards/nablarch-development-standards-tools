# Changelog

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2] - 2023-03-31
### Updates
#### Change
- Shell scripts generated by the automatic shell script generation tool and shell scripts included in scripts.zip have been fixed so that [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) warnings are not output.
- Fixed a bug in the receiving-files batch of the automatic shell script generation tool where the return value was actually 112 when the destination directory did not exist, even though the description and logs indicated that 113 would be returned.

## [1.1] - 2021-10-31
### Updates
#### Change
- The automatic format definition file generation tool has been modified to support design document following changes. (The design document is Japanese version only.)
  - In the old format, the description rule was to enclose the item ID in [ ] to indicate the hierarchical structure of the object, which was difficult to understand because it was expressed flatly in a single table. In the new format, the table is divided by hierarchy to make it easier to understand at a glance.
  - Since there was no place for the number of digits in the record definition, we added a column for the number of digits.

## [1.0-en] - 2020-08-14

  - The content is the same as the Japanese version 1.0. Only some of the content is available to the public.


## [1.0] - 2018-10-09
