# Changelog

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1] - 2021-10-31
### Updates
#### Change
- The automatic format definition file generation tool has been modified to support design document following changes. (The design document is Japanese version only.)
  - In the old format, the description rule was to enclose the item ID in [ ] to indicate the hierarchical structure of the object, which was difficult to understand because it was expressed flatly in a single table. In the new format, the table is divided by hierarchy to make it easier to understand at a glance.
  - Since there was no place for the number of digits in the record definition, we added a column for the number of digits.
